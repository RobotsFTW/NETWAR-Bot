Discord bot for the NETWAR LAN.


The bot needs a **config.py** file with all the secret api key stuff in it. Inside will look like this:  
```
bot_key = "discord api key goes here"
bot_id = discords user id for the bot  #NOTE: no quotation marks for this one. Right click on bot and then copy id
bot_prefix = ">" # you can change this to whatever you like.
```
